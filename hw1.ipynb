    "\n",
    "Задание выполняется самостоятельно. «Похожие» решения считаются плагиатом и все задействованные студенты (в том числе те, у кого списали) не могут получить за него больше 0 баллов. Весь код должен быть написан самостоятельно. Чужим кодом для пользоваться запрещается даже с указанием ссылки на источник. В разумных рамках, конечно. Взять пару очевидных строчек кода для реализации какого-то небольшого функционала можно.\n",

    "\n",
    "В этом задании вам предстоит реализовать систему, предлагающую удачное продолжение слова или нескольких следующих слов в режиме реального времени по типу тех, которые используются в телефонах, поисковой строке или приложении почты. Полученную систему вам нужно будет обернуть в пользовательский интерфейс с помощью библиотеки [reflex](https://github.com/reflex-dev/reflex), чтобы ей можно было удобно пользоваться, а так же, чтобы убедиться, что все работает как надо. В этот раз вам не придется обучать никаких моделей, мы ограничимся n-граммной генерацией.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Структура\n",
    "\n",
    "Это домашнее задание состоит из двух частей предположительно одинаковых по сложности. В первой вам нужно будет выполнить 5 заданий, по итогам которых вы получите минимально рабочее решение. А во второй, пользуясь тем, что вы уже сделали реализовать полноценную систему подсказки текста с пользовательским интерфейсом. Во второй части мы никак не будем ограничивать вашу фантазию. Делайте что угодно, лишь бы получилось в результате получился удобный фреймворк. Чем лучше у вас будет результат, тем больше баллов вы получите. Если будет совсем хорошо, то мы добавим бонусов сверху по своему усмотрению.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Оценивание\n",
    "При сдаче зададания в anytask вам будет необходимо сдать весь код, а также отчет с подробным описанием техник, которые в применили для создания вашей системы. Не лишним будет также написать и о том, что у вас не получилось и почему.\n",
    "\n",
    "За часть с заданиями можно будет получить до __5__ баллов, за отчет – до __3__ баллов, 2 балл за доп вопросы, если возникнут, если вопросов не возникло, считаем, что 2 балла вы получили "

However, he injured a\\nknee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a\\nlot of academic ground to cover to graduate.\\nThe other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;\\nLBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,\\n4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round\\nRock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North\\nLamar; DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of Tyler, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney,\\n5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.\\n* * * *\\nThe Longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and I think most of\\nthem will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes QB Vincent\\nYoung of Houston Madison, RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of\\nHouston Jersey Village, WRs Timmons, Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony\\nWright of Klein Forest, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, OLs Justin Blalock of\\nPlano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks,\\nOkla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs\\nRodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey\\nStuddard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and\\nLindale's Williams, and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland, Brodney Pool\\nof Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.\\nIf the Longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four\\ntop players on my 25-man \"difference-maker\" list.\\nThey already have No. 4 in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No.\\n1 Wright, No. 2 Young and No. 3 Dibbles.\\nIf Pikryl lived in Texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says Texas is the\\nleader right now. He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game.\\nThe Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at\\nkicking off into the end zone. Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the\\nbest I've seen this year at booting them deep. College kickers start five\\nyards farther back but DeCarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone.\\n* * * *\\nINTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT: The Longhorns lost their mystique for many\\nyears, but there are a few signs they are getting it back. Consider this item\\nin last Friday's Chicago Tribune about UT pledge Marquis Johnson, a top 50\\nnational  recruit from Champaign Cen-tennial,under a brief column entitled \"8\\nPlayers to watch:\\n\"Anytime Texas comes to Illinois to recruit a player, you know he's something\\nspecial.\"\\n\\nSubscribe To The E-Mail/Fax To Get Year-Round Football\\n&amp; Recruiting Scoops !\\nSave Big As\\nAn Internet Subscriber !\\nWhether you live close to Austin or far away, the True Orange E-Mail/Fax\\nService is the way to keep up with Longhorn football and Longhorn recruiting\\n- instantly.

I think Bo gives us the ability\\nto stretch the field, even when the ball doesn't come to him, because the\\ndefense has to be aware of where he is at all times. (Quarterback) Chris\\n(Simms) did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half.\"\\n- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis\\n* * * *\\n\"This was a great team win for us. The offense did a great job of hanging on\\nthe ball and running the clock, and the defense did a good job of getting\\nsome three-and-outs. That's the way it's supposed to work when you draw it\\nup. I give a lot of credit to (CB) Quentin Jammer and (nickel back) Dakarai\\nPearson for shutting down their big-play receivers. Jammer held (WR) Justin\\nGage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we\\ndecided to give him the primary coverage on him.\"\\n- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese\\n* * * *\\n\"I don't think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter. I think our\\noffensive line just wore them down a little. Coach Brown and coach Davis told\\nme I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep\\nrunning and pounding as hard as I could. It feels good to be part of the\\nrecord book.\"\\n- UT freshman RB Cedric Benson, talking about his game and the fact that he\\nis the first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in three straight games at\\nTexas\\n* * * *\\n\"I was getting real clean releases. I used my speed to my advantage. I was\\ngetting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and\\nour wide receivers. They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to\\nthem.\"\\n- Longhorn TE Bo Scaife, who caught five passes for 73 yards, including ones\\nfor 27 and 28 yards that set up first-half touchdowns\\n* * * *\\n\"We won and Oklahoma lost, Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA\\n(Stanford won). That's what I call a good day.\"\\n- UT quarterback Chris Simms\\n* * * *\\n\"When I heard the Oklahoma score, I was a little happy. Then I heard the\\nVirginia Tech score and I was a little happier, then the UCLA-Stanford game\\ncame as quite a surprise. That's three teams in the top five of the BCS.\"\\n- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams\\n* * * *\\n\"He's a really good cornerback. He covered me as well as anybody I've seen\\nthis year.\"\\n- Missouri wide receiver Justin Gage, talking about UT cornerback Quentin\\nJammer, who held him to a season low two catches for 14 yards\\n\\nTexas-Missouri Statistics\\n\\nScoring Summary\\nTexas            0       14         7      14   -       35\\nMissouri         0       10         0        6  -       16\\n\\nMU - Fredrickson 8 pass from Farmer (Hammerich kick) 11:12 2Q (11 plays, 76\\nyds)\\nUT - B.

I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. \\n\\nBeth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.\\n\\nMike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   \\n\\nThanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.</td>\n",

However, he injured a\\nknee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at Gulf Coast JC says he has a\\nlot of academic ground to cover to graduate.\\nThe other Longhorn pledges are DT Tully Janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of Keller;\\nLBs Brian Robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of Splendora and Marcus Myers, 6-3, 220,\\n4.5, of Pflugerville Connally;   WR Dustin Miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of Round\\nRock Westwood;  QB Billy Don Malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of  Paris North\\nLamar; DB Matt Melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of Tyler, and  RB/Ath Clint Haney,\\n5-11, 190, 4.27 of Smithson Valley.\\n* * * *\\nThe Longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and I think most of\\nthem will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes QB Vincent\\nYoung of Houston Madison, RBs Albert Hardy of Galena Park and Selvin Young of\\nHouston Jersey Village, WRs Timmons, Biren Ealy of Cypress Falls and Anthony\\nWright of Klein Forest, TE Eric Winston of Midland Lee, OLs Justin Blalock of\\nPlano East and Tony Ugoh of Spring Westfield, DEs Bryan Pickryl of Jenks,\\nOkla., Larry Dibbles of Lancaster and Travis Leitko of The Woodlands, DTs\\nRodrique Wright of Alief Hastings, Marco Martin of Mesquite and Kasey\\nStuddard of Highlands Ranch, Colo., LBs Aaron Harris of North Mesquite and\\nLindale's Williams, and DBs Edorian McCullough of North Garland, Brodney Pool\\nof Houston Westbury and Ricky Wilson of Port Arthur Lincoln.\\nIf the Longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four\\ntop players on my 25-man \"difference-maker\" list.\\nThey already have No. 4 in Earl Anderson and they have very good shots at No.\\n1 Wright, No. 2 Young and No. 3 Dibbles.\\nIf Pikryl lived in Texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says Texas is the\\nleader right now. He took his official visit the weekend of the Colorado game.\\nThe Longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at\\nkicking off into the end zone. Trey DeCarlo at Carrollton Creekview is the\\nbest I've seen this year at booting them deep. College kickers start five\\nyards farther back but DeCarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone.\\n* * * *\\nINTERESTING RECRUITING TIDBIT: The Longhorns lost their mystique for many\\nyears, but there are a few signs they are getting it back.

I think Bo gives us the ability\\nto stretch the field, even when the ball doesn't come to him, because the\\ndefense has to be aware of where he is at all times. (Quarterback) Chris\\n(Simms) did a great job looking off on his big catch just before the half.\"\\n- Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis\\n* * * *\\n\"This was a great team win for us. The offense did a great job of hanging on\\nthe ball and running the clock, and the defense did a good job of getting\\nsome three-and-outs. That's the way it's supposed to work when you draw it\\nup. I give a lot of credit to (CB) Quentin Jammer and (nickel back) Dakarai\\nPearson for shutting down their big-play receivers. Jammer held (WR) Justin\\nGage to two catches and Dak really did a good job on their tight end after we\\ndecided to give him the primary coverage on him.\"\\n- UT defensive coordinator Carl Reese\\n* * * *\\n\"I don't think I was running any harder in the fourth quarter. I think our\\noffensive line just wore them down a little. Coach Brown and coach Davis told\\nme I needed to take charge in the fourth quarter and I just tried to keep\\nrunning and pounding as hard as I could. It feels good to be part of the\\nrecord book.\"\\n- UT freshman RB Cedric Benson, talking about his game and the fact that he\\nis the first true freshman to rush for 100 yards in three straight games at\\nTexas\\n* * * *\\n\"I was getting real clean releases. I used my speed to my advantage. I was\\ngetting single coverage because they were worrying about our running game and\\nour wide receivers. They were just sitting back waiting for me to come to\\nthem.\"\\n- Longhorn TE Bo Scaife, who caught five passes for 73 yards, including ones\\nfor 27 and 28 yards that set up first-half touchdowns\\n* * * *\\n\"We won and Oklahoma lost, Virginia Tech lost and Stanford is ahead of UCLA\\n(Stanford won). That's what I call a good day.\"\\n- UT quarterback Chris Simms\\n* * * *\\n\"When I heard the Oklahoma score, I was a little happy. Then I heard the\\nVirginia Tech score and I was a little happier, then the UCLA-Stanford game\\ncame as quite a surprise. That's three teams in the top five of the BCS.\"\\n- Longhorn wide receiver Roy Williams\\n* * * *\\n\"He's a really good cornerback. He covered me as well as anybody I've seen\\nthis year.\"\\n- Missouri wide receiver Justin Gage, talking about UT cornerback Quentin\\nJammer, who held him to a season low two catches for 14 yards\\n\\nTexas-Missouri Statistics\\n\\nScoring Summary\\nTexas            0       14         7      14   -       35\\nMissouri         0       10         0        6  -       16\\n\\nMU - Fredrickson 8 pass from Farmer (Hammerich kick) 11:12 2Q (11 plays, 76\\nyds)\\nUT - B.

for Enron Americas. Bob previously served as one of the business controllers for gas operations for Enron Americas, with direct responsibility for Gas Logistics and Volume Management.  The leadership team reporting to Bob will include Peggy Hedstrom (Calgary Operations), Jeff Gossett ( U.S. Gas Risk and South America Operations), Stacey White (U.S. Power Risk), Leslie Reeves (U.S. Gas and Power Confirmations and Settlements), and Bob Superty (U.S. Gas Logistics). \\n\\nBrent Price will continue to lead Operations for Enron Global Markets and fulfill his dual role as Chief Accounting Officer for Enron Global Markets. \\n\\nI am very pleased to announce that Kevin Sweeney will lead Operations for Enron Industrial Markets.  Kevin brings to his new role extensive risk and operations experience from stints in our Houston, London and Singapore offices.  Kevin fills the role that was previously held by Brenda Herod, who will now report directly to Beth Apollo. \\n\\nBeth Apollo will be the Operations Project Manager for the assimilation of EES Wholesale. This will include Deal Capture, Risk Analysis,  Confirmations, and Global Data functions which have been moved into EWS under Global Risk Management Operations.  Successfully leveraging the infrastructure to support the EES business plan will also require close coordination with Gas Logistics, Settlements and the Operational Analysis (OA) process, and Beth will actively coordinate operations efforts with these teams and the commercial teams.  I have asked Beth to project manage the effort to look for opportunities to streamline and improve systems, processes and controls, and to consider alignment, where it makes sense, with existing EWS processes.  Reporting to Beth will be Scott Mills, with a focus on Deal Capture, Risk Analysis and Confirmations, and  Brenda Herod, with a focus on invoicing control guidelines and reporting requirements. \\n\\nBeth will also continue to manage the Global Services function, which includes the consolidated DPR process and Global Operations Standards, led by Shona Wilson, and the Global Data function which is lead by James Scribner.\\n\\nMike Jordan will continue to lead operations for Enron Europe, working closely with me and other EWS operations leads to insure the proliferation of best operational practices worldwide for Enron.   \\n\\nThanks for your continued support especially in exploring and seizing commercial opportunities to strengthen our contributions to Enron.   \n",

to me that we can proceed one of 2 ways.  Those alternatives are as follows:\\n\\n\\t\\t1.  We could write a letter to Texaco and demand payment for the withheld amount.\\n\\n\\t\\t2.  If we are paying them this month, we could withhold the $1.5 million from the\\n\\t\\t    amount we are paying them.  Of course, we would need to provide them some \\n\\t\\t    sort of explanation.\\n\\n\\tMy preference at this time would be to do the first item.  If you could have someone provide me with the details of the transaction they withheld the money on I could draft the letter.  If that letter brought no response, then we could consider taking the action outlined in the second item.\\n\\n\\tI trust all is well with you.  I look forward to hearing from you.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\nJeff\\n\\n -----Original Message-----\\nFrom: \\tGrigsby, Mike  \\nSent:\\tMonday, October 22, 2001 5:00 PM\\nTo:\\tHodge, Jeffrey T.\\nSubject:\\tTexaco\\n\\nJeff,\\n\\nHow should proceed with Texaco and their 1.5 million withholding?\\n\\n\\nThanks,\\nMike   \n",

Мы будем вызывать функцию поиска подходящих слов после каждой напечатанной пользователем буквы. Поэтому нам очень важно, чтобы поиск работал как можно быстрее. Простой перебор всех слов занимает $O(|V| \\cdot n)$ времени, где $|V|$ – размер словаря, а $n$ – длина префикса. Мы же напишем [префиксное дерево](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Префиксное_дерево), которое позволяет искать слова за $O(n + m)$, где $m$ – число подходящих слов."
